# StatelessPasswordManager

This Android app is a stateless password manager, which means there is no vault, no server, and it doesn't save any kind of state on the phone.

You no longer need to remember or write down passwords, just enter a specific **phrase** like **'instagram'** and the app will return a generated **password** for that **phrase**.

The password is generated by a **custom algorithm** that you must create for your app before you build it. 

Also the app has **custom password** and **biometric** security.

Instalation
-----------

First you need to clone the repository or [download it](https://github.com/MarcosTypeAP/StatelessPasswordManager/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

```bash
#!/bin/bash

git clone https://github.com/MarcosTypeAP/StatelessPasswordManager.git
cd StatelessPasswordManager/
```

You also need to install [**Android Studio**](https://developer.android.com/studio) with a minimum of **SDK 26 (Android 8.0)**.

### Needed files

For the password security you need create a file named `EnvironmentVariables.kt` and save it in `app/src/main/java/com/sombromar/passwdgen/` .

The file must containg a Kotlin object with the password you want to use hashed with **SHA-512**.

###### File template

```kotlin
package com.sombromar.passwdgen

object EnvironmentVariables {
    const val PASSWORD_HASH = "<Your SHA-512 hashed password>"
}
```

#### Password generator algorithm

For this you need to create another file named `PasswordGenerator.kt` and save the file in `app/src/main/java/com/sombromar/passwdgen/`.

The file must contain a Kotlin class named `PasswordGenerator` that must contain an attribute named `generatedPasswd` and a method named `genPassword` that will generate and save the password in the previous attribute.

###### File template

```kotlin
package com.sombromar.passwdgen

class PasswordGenerator {
    var generatedPasswd: String = ""

    fun genPassword(phrase: String) {
        // TODO
        this.generatedPasswd = "<Generated Password>"
    }
}
```

Build
-----

To build the app you need to open the project in Android Studio and go to **Build**->**Build APK**, An apk will be generated in `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`, after that just transfer it to your phone and install it.
